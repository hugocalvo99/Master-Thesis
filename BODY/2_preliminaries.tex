In this chapter we will present some basic concepts necessary to later build 

\section{Type IIB string theory}

%Action, spectrum, GSO projection. Make clear this is not orbifolded

\section{Orbifolds}

%Brief general description, orbifolds with singular points. Freely acting orbifolds.
 
\subsection{D-branes}

%Boundary conditions, talk about fermions too. Argue that only sym orbifolds admit single branes.

\section{Supersymmetry}

%Specific discusion around string theory. Closed 32 supercharges, branes are 1/2-BPS objects, D1/D5 is 1/4-BPS. Representations of supercharges
